#  (PROSPER LOAN DATA EXPLORATION)
## by (SAMUEL OFUOKWU)


## Dataset

This dataset is the Prosper Loan dataset that records 113,937 entries of loans from to accounting for 81 variables, the purpose of this exploration is to explore the relationship between the variables and see the common feautures amongst the Creditgrades categories from worse to bad (HR - AA) and the factors considered when giving out loans to loanees.


## Summary of Findings

During the course of my analytical and exploratory process I realised that there are certain factors that are considered before a specific amount of loan is given to a customer. Only loanees with high creditgrade had access to high loan amounts.
There were specific feautures I noticed about Loanees with high grades they have high proportion of home owners, they have relatively higher incomerange, they are mostly employed, They have lower borrower rate, they have high loan amounts i believe these factors were considered before filtering the loanees into creditgrades.
Majorly the distribution of the debt to income rate shows that the loans disbursed are majorly given to customers with low debt to income ratio where it peaked at 0.20 and the higher the debt to income ratio the lower the frequency.
I also discovered that lower loans have higher tendecy to be completed than higher loan amounts.
Home owners also have the tendency to have higher creditgrades and also higher loans.
Home owners have higher debt to income ratios they are given more trust to pay back their loans than those people without homes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the feautures and trends amongst the creditgrade category, distribution of borrower rates, Loan original amounts and debt to income ratio. I start by introducing the frequency of creditgrade , the distribution of the borrowerrates,Loan original amount and the debt to income ratio. 
And then i went to to explore how loan amounts and borrower rates are affected by the credit grade, term of loan and home owner status.
And finally how Home owners have higher debt to income ratio than non-home owners.
